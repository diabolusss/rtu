Compile this
program for ARM, but compile it statically; as you are trying to create a small dummy
filesystem, you will not use any library in it. In GCC, the -static option does this for you:

arm-none-linux-gnueabi-gcc hello.c -static -o hello

Use the output file to create a root filesystem. T he command cpio is used for this purpose.
Execute the following command:
# echo hello | cpio -o --format=newc > rootfs

check the output file:
# file rootfs
rootfs: ASCII cpio archive (SVR4 with no CRC)
